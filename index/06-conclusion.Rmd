# Conclusion {#chapter6}
In this Honors thesis, we present a more efficient and user-friendly way for **R** users to retrieve trip record of both taxi and other ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, in New York City. 

By analyzing trip records of New York City’s yellow taxi, we found answers to questions that are of obvious interest to taxi drivers, passengers, and TLC officials.

We found which taxi zones have passengers who offer the highest percent of tips, and we showed that taxi drivers do get compensated more during rush hours. We helped passengers to know the average time it takes to go to one of the three airports in New York City so that passengers can plan their trips accordingly. We also found that the \$52 flat rate between Manhattan and JFK Airport is beneficial for the passengers, because it is cheaper than the average amount of fare that passenger would need to pay without the flat rate. We have also shown that the flat rate does not discourage drivers, even though taxi drivers would have be paid more without the flat rate.

We suggest passengers to use our Shiny App to choose a pick up zone of their interest and then decide when is the most favorable time for them to travel to any airport in New York. We recommend New York City TLC to modify the fare on rainy or snowy days to incentive taxicab drivers to pick up more trips in order to make street-hail service more affordable on rainy days for passengers. We also suggest the TLC to keep the \$52 flat rate between Manhattan and JFK Airport so that passengers do not have any uncertainty in cost and they are more willing to take a taxi to travel to JFK Airport from Manhattan.

## Future Research
We would love to investigate the sharp decline in the consumption of NYC yellow cab after e-hail services were introduced into the NYC ride-hail market. By looking into the patterns in market shares, it might be possible for one to predict the future market share distribution and find out what features of ride-hail transportation are the ones that affect market share the most. 

We also want to study what the impact of introducing new GPS and entertainment system is on the number of rides. The global product and marketing director at Verifone, Jason Gross, said that, “We like to say that we provide what Uber says it provides.” With the raised expectation among rides caused by Uber and Lyft, yellow taxi industry need to respond quickly [@andrew2016]. How does the market react to the newly installed entertainment system? Has the market share of yellow cab rebounded since the installation of the entertainment system in 2016? 

As mentioned in Chapter 3, we also want to study the correlation between number of trips and average percent tips in each taxi zone. If more taxi-zone-specific data is provided, we could find out the true correlation between the two variables.
