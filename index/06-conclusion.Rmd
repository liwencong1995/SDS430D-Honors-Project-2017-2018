## Future Research

For future study, I would love to investigate the sharp decline in the consumption of NYC yellow cab after e-hail services were introduced into the NYC ride-hail market. I also want to study what the impact of introducing new GPS and entertainment system is on the number of rides. The global product and marketing at Verifone, Jason Gross, said that, “I like to say that we provide what Uber says it provides.” With the raised expectation among rides caused by Uber and Lyft, yellow taxi industry need to respond quickly. How does the market react to the newly installed entertainment system? Has the market share of yellow cab rebounded since 2016? By looking into the patterns in market shares, it might be possible for me to predict the future market share distribution and find out what features of ride-hail transportation are the ones that affect market share distribution the most.
