# Conclusion {#chapter6}
In this Honors thesis, we present a more efficient and easy-to-use way for users to retrieve trip records information of both New York City taxi and other ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, in New York City. 

By analyzing trip records of New York City’s yellow taxi, we found answers to questions that are commonly asked by taxi drivers, passengers, and TLC officials.

We found which taxi zones have passengers who offer the highest percent of tips, and we proved that taxi drivers do get compensated more during rush hours. We are able to help passengers to know the average time it takes to go to one of the three airports in New York City so that passengers can plan their trips accordingly. We also found that the \$52 flat rate between Manhattan and JFK Airport is beneficial for the passengers, because it is cheaper than the average amount of fare that passenger would need to pay without the flat rate.

## Future Research
For future study, we would love to investigate the sharp decline in the consumption of NYC yellow cab after e-hail services were introduced into the NYC ride-hail market. We also want to study what the impact of introducing new GPS and entertainment system is on the number of rides. The global product and marketing at Verifone, Jason Gross, said that, “We like to say that we provide what Uber says it provides.” With the raised expectation among rides caused by Uber and Lyft, yellow taxi industry need to respond quickly [@andrew2016]. How does the market react to the newly installed entertainment system? Has the market share of yellow cab rebounded since 2016? By looking into the patterns in market shares, it might be possible for me to predict the future market share distribution and find out what features of ride-hail transportation are the ones that affect market share distribution the most.
