# Using New York City Yellow Taxi Data to Answer Real Life Problems 
New York City taxi drivers, passengers, and NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission are the three parties who are closely involved in the NYC taxi industry. Each party has its own needs: taxi drivers want to maxmize their profit, and in order to do that, they need to maximize the revenue while minimizing the cost. Taxi passengers want the cheapest and most convenient way of transportantion. Since Uber and Lyft launched their services in New York City, many consumers started to demand the cheaper e-hail services. TLC wants to protect both taxi drivers and passengers, and it creates policies to make NYC taxi more accessible to consumers who really need this service. In this section, I think about what each party wants and try to find a way for them to be better-off.
