Yellow Taxi Cab is widely recognized as an important part of New York City. Each taxi trip record is like a little piece of a gigantic puzzle, and all together they tell a story of what happens in New York City everyday. Since New York City taxi data is too big to be used for data analysis in R, we need a tool that helps users to answer questions of NYC Street-Hail Services in R. This thesis presents an efficient and easy-to-use way to retrieve trip information of both taxi and other ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, in New York City. By analyzing trip records of New York City's yellow cab, we answer questions that are commonly asked by taxi drivers, passengers, and New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) officials to help all three parties to improve their services or experiences.
