Yellow Taxi Cabs are widely recognized as the icons of New York City. The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) provides publicly accessible yellow and green taxi trip records. [@datayellowmonth] Each taxi trip record is like a little piece of a gigantic puzzle, and all together they tell a story of what happens in New York City. This thesis presents a more efficient and easy-to-use way for users to retrieve trip records information of both New York City taxi and other ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, in New York City. By analyzing trip records of New York Cityâ€™s iconic yellow taxi, we seek answers to questions that are commonly asked by taxi drivers, passengers, and TLC officials to help all three parties to improve their services or experiences.
