# Abstract {-}
The New York City Taxi Cabs are widely recognized as the icons of New York City. The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission provide publicly accessible yellow and green taxi trip records for people to do research with. Each taxi trip record is like a little piece of a gigantic puzzle, and all together they draw a picture of what is happening in New York City every day. This thesis presents a more efficient and easy-to-use way for users to retrieve information of both New York City taxi trip record and trip records of other ridesharing services in New York City, such as Uber and Lyft. By focusing on New York City’s iconic yellow taxi’s trip records, we investigate social and taxi pricing questions. Additionally, this thesis illustrates a way for taxi drivers to better understand where the customers are and where the customers try to go.
