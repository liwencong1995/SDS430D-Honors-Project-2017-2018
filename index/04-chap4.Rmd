# New York City Taxi Passengers {#chapter4}

## How long does it take passengers to get to JFK, La Guardia, and Newark Airports from anywhere in New York City? 

We want to calculate the average number of minutes it takes to go to all three airport from a specific taxi zone at every hour. First, we want to focus on trips going to any of the three airports, JFK, LaGuardia, or Newark Airport. We need to load trip records with destination as one of the three airports from the MySQL connection we built.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
db <- src_mysql("nyctaxi", user = "wli37", host = "scidb.smith.edu", password = "Calculati0n")
taxi <- etl("nyctaxi", db)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# extract data of trips going to JFK Airport
# from MySQL database
to_jfk_trip <- taxi %>%
  tbl("yellow") %>%
  filter(DOLocationID == 132) 

# extract data of trips going to La Guardia Airport
# from MySQL database
to_lg_trip <- taxi %>%
  tbl("yellow") %>%
  filter(DOLocationID == 138) 

# extract data of trips going to Newark Airport
# from MySQL database
to_newark_trip <- taxi %>%
  tbl("yellow") %>%
  filter(DOLocationID == 1) 
```

Now we want to calculate the average amount of time it take from each zone to one of the three airports during each hour.
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
to_jfk_zone <- to_jfk_trip %>%
  mutate(tpep_dropoff_datetime = ymd_hms(tpep_dropoff_datetime,  
                                         tz= "America/New_York"),
         tpep_pickup_datetime = ymd_hms(tpep_pickup_datetime,  
                                        tz= "America/New_York")) %>%
  mutate(min = round((tpep_dropoff_datetime - tpep_pickup_datetime)/60, 2),
         hour = hour(tpep_pickup_datetime)) %>%
  mutate(min = as.numeric(min),
         min_dis = min/trip_distance) %>%
  filter(PULocationID != DOLocationID) %>%
  filter(min > 3) %>%
  filter(fare_amount > 0) %>%
  filter(tip_amount > 0) %>%
  filter(tip_amount < fare_amount) %>%
  filter(trip_distance > 1) %>%
  filter(payment_type < 3) %>%
  filter(PULocationID <264) %>%
  filter(1 < min_dis) %>% 
  filter(min_dis < 30) %>%
  group_by(PULocationID, hour) %>%
  summarise(avg_min = mean(min)) %>%
  arrange(PULocationID)

to_lg_zone <- to_lg_trip %>%
  mutate(tpep_dropoff_datetime = ymd_hms(tpep_dropoff_datetime,  
                                         tz= "America/New_York"),
         tpep_pickup_datetime = ymd_hms(tpep_pickup_datetime,  
                                        tz= "America/New_York")) %>%
  mutate(min = round((tpep_dropoff_datetime - tpep_pickup_datetime)/60, 2),
         hour = hour(tpep_pickup_datetime)) %>%
  mutate(min = as.numeric(min),
         min_dis = min/trip_distance) %>%
  filter(PULocationID != DOLocationID) %>%
  filter(min > 3) %>%

  filter(tip_amount < fare_amount) %>%
  filter(trip_distance > 1) %>%
  filter(payment_type < 3) %>%
  filter(PULocationID <264) %>%
  filter(1 < min_dis) %>% 
  filter(min_dis < 30) %>%
  group_by(PULocationID, hour) %>%
  summarise(avg_min = mean(min)) %>%
  arrange(PULocationID)

to_newark_zone <- to_newark_trip %>%
  mutate(tpep_dropoff_datetime = ymd_hms(tpep_dropoff_datetime,  
                                         tz= "America/New_York"),
         tpep_pickup_datetime = ymd_hms(tpep_pickup_datetime,  
                                        tz= "America/New_York")) %>%
  mutate(min = round((tpep_dropoff_datetime - tpep_pickup_datetime)/60, 2),
         hour = hour(tpep_pickup_datetime)) %>%
  mutate(min = as.numeric(min),
         min_dis = min/trip_distance) %>%
  filter(PULocationID != DOLocationID) %>%
  filter(min > 3) %>%
  filter(fare_amount > 0) %>%
  filter(tip_amount > 0) %>%
  filter(tip_amount < fare_amount) %>%
  filter(trip_distance > 1) %>%
  filter(payment_type < 3) %>%
  filter(PULocationID <264) %>%
  filter(1 < min_dis) %>% 
  filter(min_dis < 30) %>%
  group_by(PULocationID, hour) %>%
  summarise(avg_min = mean(min)) %>%
  arrange(PULocationID)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fwrite(to_jfk_zone, "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/to_jfk_zone.csv")
fwrite(to_lg_zone, "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/to_lg_zone.csv")
fwrite(to_newark_zone, "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/to_newark_zone.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
to_jfk_zone <- fread("/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/to_jfk_zone.csv")
to_lg_zone <- fread("/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/to_lg_zone.csv")
to_newark_zone <- fread("/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/to_newark_zone.csv")
```

So far, we have created three tables summarizing the average number of minutes it takes to go to all three airports for every hour from different taxi zones. It would be easier if we combine all three tables and put information related to trip duration to all three airports in the same table. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
to_jfk_zone <- to_jfk_zone %>%
  mutate(airport = "JFK") %>%
  rename(avg_min = jfk_avg_min)

to_lg_zone <- to_lg_zone %>%
  mutate(airport = "LGA") %>%
  rename(avg_min = jfk_avg_min)

to_newark_zone <- to_newark_zone %>%
  mutate(airport = "EWR") %>%
  rename(avg_min = jfk_avg_min)

three_air <- bind_rows(to_jfk_zone, to_lg_zone, to_newark_zone)
three_air_1 <- three_air %>%
  rename(LocationID = PULocationID) %>%
  left_join(taxi_zone_lookup, by = "LocationID")

```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
names(three_air_1) <- c("PULocation", "Hour of Departure", "Average Number of Minutes", "Airport", "Borough", "Zone")
kable(three_air_1[10:22,c(5,6,2,3)], 
      caption = "Average number of minutes it takes from Alphabet City, Manhattan to JFK Airport during different hours",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```
Table 4.1 displays the average number of minutes it takes from Alphabet City, Manhattan to JFK Airport during different hours.

### Case Study: From Central Park, Manhattan to all three airports
Central Park, Manhattan has pick-up zone ID number 43. Let's take a look at how much time is needed to travel to all three airports from taxi zone No.4.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
alphabet <- three_air %>%
  filter(PULocationID == 43)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
airport_vis <- ggplot(data = alphabet, 
                     aes(x = hour, y = avg_min, colour = airport)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = airport)) + geom_point() +
  xlab("Hour of Departure") +
  ylab("Average Total Time (Minutes)") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 23), breaks = c(0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24))
airport_vis
```

```{r airport-vis, fig.cap="Average number of minutes it takes from Central Park, Manhattan to all three airports during different hours", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/airport_vis.png", dpi = 120 )
```

According to the red line Figure \@ref(fig:airport-vis), it takes the least time, less than 30 minutes, to travel from Central Park, Manhattan to Newark Airport around 4 AM in the morning and it takes more than 70 minutes around 11 PM at night.

According to the green line, it only takes about 30 minutes to travel to JFK Airport around 4 AM in the morning, and it takes the most time, about 70 minutes, around 4 PM in the afternoon.

As shown by the blue line, it takes the least time, about 20 minutes, to travel to La Guardia Airport at 2 AM at midnight, and it takes a little more than 40 minutes around 4 PM in the evening. 

Being able to know the average time it takes to go to one of the airports ahead, passengers can buy their flight tickets accordingly. For example, a mum who wants to visit Disney World with her kids can use this visualization to estimate the amount of time needed for her and her families to catch their flight. If this mum wants to catch a flight that departs at 10 AM from JFK Airport, then when she should depart from Central Park in order to get to the airport on time? According to Figure \@ref(fig:airport-vis), she can depart at 7 AM, and it will take a little bit more than 40 minutes for her to get to JFK Airport to catch her 10 AM flight.

### A Shiny App: When is the best time to travel to JFK Airport?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(rsconnect)

list_of_zones <- taxi_zone_lookup$Zone

three_air_zone <- three_air %>%
  rename(LocationID = PULocationID)%>%
  left_join(taxi_zone_lookup, by = "LocationID") %>%
  rename(PULocationID = LocationID)

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel(title=h4("Number of Minutes", align="center")), 
  selectInput("taxizone", "Taxi Pick-Up Zone:", list_of_zones),
  mainPanel(plotOutput("plot2")) )

server <- function(input,output) {
  dat <- reactive({
    test <- three_air_zone %>% dplyr::filter(Zone == input$taxizone)
    print(test)
    test
  })
  
  output$plot2 <- renderPlot({
    p1 <- ggplot(dat(), 
                     aes(x = hour, y = avg_min, colour = airport)) +
      geom_line(aes(group = airport)) + geom_point() +
      xlab("Hour of Departure") +
      ylab("Average Number of Minutes") +
      scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 23))
    p1
    })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r shinyapp, fig.caption = "Shiny App: Average Number of Minutes Takes to Go to All Three Airports",fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/shinyapp.png", dpi = 100 )
```
According to \@ref(fig:shinyapp), a person travelling from Times Square to JFK Airport to catch a 11AM flight need to depart around 8:30 AM in order to arrive at the airport 2 hours before the flight departs. 

This Shiny App helps passengers to estimate the amount of time that is needed for them to travel to any one of the these three airports from any New York City taxi zones. 

## How does weather affect the number of taxi and Uber trips?
On a snowy or rainy day, it is hard for passengers to find a yellow cab on the street. Taxi drivers get paid at the same rate no matter how bad the weather gets, so they tend to stay at home instead of going out to work when the weather is bad. Uber drivers, however, get paid more on a snowy or rainy day, since Uber uses a pricing model that takes supply and demand into account. When weather is bad, demand for rides is higher, so Uber fare rate increases. Uber's pricing model gives Uber drivers an incentive to work extra hard on ugly days. 

In this section, we study the number of pickups of yellow cab and Uber. We compare number of pick-ups in each taxi zone in the weeks of bad weather with previous weeks' total number of pick-ups to see whether Uber drivers have an incentive to drive around the city more when weather gets bad.

**Uber Weekly Data**
We first calculated the number of total dispatched trips of Uber by using weekly-aggregated Uber pick-up data available on NYC OpenData [@datauberweek], and summary is shown in Table 4.2.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
download.file("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/gt3n-7ri6.csv?years=2017&$limit=50000", destfile = "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/uber_weekly_data.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
uber_weekly_data <- fread("/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/uber_weekly_data.csv")

uber_weekly <- uber_weekly_data %>%
  group_by(`Pickup Start Date`, `Pickup End Date`) %>%
  summarise(`Total Dispatched Trips` = sum(`Total Dispatched Trips`)) %>%
  rename(`Uber Total Dispatched Trips` = `Total Dispatched Trips`) 

uber_weekly <- uber_weekly %>%
  mutate(month = substr(`Pickup Start Date`, 1, 2),
         day = substr(`Pickup Start Date`, 4, 5)) %>%
  mutate(`Pickup Start Date 1` = paste0("2017-", month, "-", day)) %>%
  select(-`Pickup Start Date`) %>%
  rename(`Pickup Start Date` = `Pickup Start Date 1`)
uber_weekly <- uber_weekly[, c(6,2,3)]

uber_weekly_1 <- uber_weekly %>%
  mutate(month = substr(`Pickup End Date`, 1, 2),
         day = substr(`Pickup End Date`, 4, 5)) %>%
  mutate(`Pickup End Date` = paste0("2017-", month, "-", day))

```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(uber_weekly_1[1:10,1:3], 
      caption = "Uber 2017 Weekly Total Dispatched Trips",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

#### Yellow Cab Weekly Data
We also calculated the number of total dispatched trips of New York City yellow cabs by using `nyctaxi` package to retrieve yellow taxi data from 2017, and the summary is shown in Table 4.3.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
db <- src_mysql("nyctaxi", user = "wli37", host = "scidb.smith.edu", password = "Calculati0n")
taxi <- etl("nyctaxi", db)

yellow_date <- taxi %>%
  tbl("yellow") %>%
  select(tpep_dropoff_datetime, tpep_pickup_datetime) %>%
  collect(n = Inf)

yellow_weekly <- yellow_weekly %>%
  mutate(`Pickup Start Date` = floor_date(tpep_pickup_datetime, unit = "week")) %>%
  group_by(`Pickup Start Date`) %>%
  summarise(`Total Dispatched Trips` = n()) %>%
  mutate(`Pickup Start Date` = ymd(`Pickup Start Date`))

fwrite(yellow_weekly, "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/yellow_weekly_data.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
yellow_weekly_data <- fread("/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/yellow_weekly_data.csv")
yellow_weekly_data <- yellow_weekly_data %>%
  rename(`Yellow Total Dispatched Trips` = `Total Dispatched Trips`) %>%
  left_join(uber_weekly, by = "Pickup Start Date") %>%
  select(-`Uber Total Dispatched Trips`)
yellow_weekly <- yellow_weekly_data[, c(1,3,2)]
yellow_weekly_1 <- yellow_weekly %>%
  mutate(month = substr(`Pickup End Date`, 1, 2),
         day = substr(`Pickup End Date`, 4, 5)) %>%
  mutate(`Pickup End Date` = paste0("2017-", month, "-", day))
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(yellow_weekly_1[1:10,1:3], 
      caption = "Yellow Taxi 2017 Weekly Total Dispatched Trips",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

### Case Study: March 14th, 2017 Snow Storm
On March 14th, 2017, a snow storm brought seven inches of snow to New York City.

**Yellow Taxi**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
yellow <- yellow_weekly_1 %>%
  filter(`Pickup Start Date` == "2017-03-12" | `Pickup Start Date` == "2017-03-05")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(yellow[,1:3], 
      caption = "Yellow Taxi Total Dispatched Trips",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

```{r}
(2066285-2456285)/2456285
```

Yellow taxi's number of total dispatched trips declined by 15% (see Table 4.4).

**Uber**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
uber <- uber_weekly_1 %>%
  filter(`Pickup Start Date` == "2017-03-12" | `Pickup Start Date` == "2017-03-05")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(uber[,1:3], 
      caption = "Uber Total Dispatched Trips",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

```{r}
(3430189-3614559)/3614559
```
Uber's number of total dispatched trips declined by 5% (see Table 4.5).

In this case, we observe that the percent decline in Uber's total number of pick-ups is 10% less than the percent decline in Yellow Taxi's total number of drop-off. Even though the total number of Uber pick-ups did not increase, Uber's pricing model may keep more drivers in the market on a snowy day.

### Case Study: Impact of Precipitation on Taxi Rides
People living in New York might have noticed that it is hard to find a taxi on the street when it rains. Economists have studied this phenomena for a long time, and an analysis that studied the correlation between taxi movement and hourly rainfall data in Central Park from 2009 to 2013 found that there is no significant correlation between a driver's hourly wage and precipitation in the city, which implies that drivers don't earn more or less when it rains [@citylab]. 

We got access to the 2017 daily Central Park weather data from the National Climatic Data Center by submitting a Climate Data Online request (Appendix D) to National Centers for Environmental Information [@noaa], and joined it to the 2017 taxi data to study relationship between rainfall and taxi rides. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
weather <- fread("data/nyc_weather_2017.csv")
weather_day <- weather %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(DATE, tz= "America/New_York")) %>%
  mutate(month = month(date),
         day = day(date)) %>%
  select(STATION_NAME, DATE, date, month, day, HOURLYPrecip) %>%
  mutate(`Pickup Start Date` = floor_date(date, unit = "week"),
         `Pickup End Date` = ceiling_date(date, unit = "week")) %>%
  filter(HOURLYPrecip != "T") %>%
  mutate(rainfall = substr(HOURLYPrecip, 1,4)) %>%
  mutate(rainfall = as.numeric(rainfall)) %>%
  group_by(`Pickup Start Date`, `Pickup End Date`) %>%
  summarise(`Weekly Rainfall` = sum(rainfall, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Weekly Rainfall`))
```

First, we generate a list of total amount of daily rainfall in New York City and we pick the 10 weeks that have the most rainfall in 2017 (see Table 4.6).

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(weather_day[1:10,],
      caption = "10 weeks that have the most rainfall in 2017",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

We then find the weekly total number of dispatched yellow taxi trips of the 10 weeks with the most rainfall (see Table 4.7).

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
weather_week <- weather_day %>%
  mutate(`Last Week Date` = as.Date(`Pickup Start Date`)-7) %>%
  mutate(`Last Week Date` = as.character(`Last Week Date`),
         `Pickup Start Date 1` = as.character(`Pickup Start Date`))
weather_week <- weather_week[, 2:5]
weather_week <- weather_week %>%
  rename(`Pickup Start Date` = `Pickup Start Date 1`)
yellow_weekly <- yellow_weekly %>%
  mutate(`Pickup Start Date` = as.character(`Pickup Start Date`))

#yellow
weather_yellow <- weather_week %>%
  left_join(yellow_weekly, by = "Pickup Start Date") %>%
  rename(`Dispatched Trips` = `Yellow Total Dispatched Trips`)
weather_yellow <- weather_yellow %>%
  left_join(yellow_weekly, by = c("Last Week Date" = "Pickup Start Date")) %>%
  rename(`Last Week Trips` = `Yellow Total Dispatched Trips`,
         `Pickup Date` = `Pickup Start Date`)
weather_yellow_1 <- weather_yellow %>%
  mutate(`% Change Trips` = ((`Dispatched Trips`-`Last Week Trips`)/`Last Week Trips`) *100) %>%
  mutate(`% Change Trips` = round(`% Change Trips`, 2))
weather_yellow_1 <- weather_yellow_1[, c(4, 6, 3, 8, 9)]
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(weather_yellow_1[1:10,],
      caption = "10 weeks that have the most rainfall in 2017 and the total number of dispatched yellow taxi trips in those weeks",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

We also need to add the weekly total number of dispatched Uber trips of the 10 weeks with the most rainfall (see Table 4.8).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Uber
weather_uber <- weather_week %>%
  left_join(uber_weekly, by = "Pickup Start Date") %>%
  rename(`Dispatched Trips` = `Uber Total Dispatched Trips`)

weather_uber <- weather_uber %>%
  left_join(uber_weekly, by = c("Last Week Date" = "Pickup Start Date")) %>%
  rename(`Last Week Trips` = `Uber Total Dispatched Trips`,
         `Pickup Date` = `Pickup Start Date`)

weather_uber_1 <- weather_uber %>%
  mutate(`% Change Trips` = ((`Dispatched Trips`-`Last Week Trips`)/`Last Week Trips`) *100) %>%
  mutate(`% Change Trips` = round(`% Change Trips`, 2))
weather_uber_1 <- weather_uber_1[, c(4, 6, 3, 8, 9)]
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(weather_uber_1[1:10,],
      caption = "10 weeks that have the most rainfall in 2017 and the total number of dispatched Uber trips in those weeks",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

We combine the percentage change in total number of dispatched trips of yellow taxi and Uber, and we compare the result (see Table 4.9).

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
##total
weather_week$Uber <- weather_uber_1$`% Change Trips`
weather_week$Yellow <- weather_yellow_1$`% Change Trips`
weather_week <- weather_week[, c(4,2,3,5,6)]
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(weather_week[1:10,],
      caption = "The percentage change in total number of dispatched trips comparing to the previous weeks of yellow taxi and Uber",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

Besides the week of April 30th, 2017, all other weeks have higher increases in the number of total dispatched trips of Uber or lower declines in the number of weekly Uber trips. Therefore, on rainy days, Uber drivers tend to increase the number of trips they drive at a higher rate.

We then plot the weekly rainfall and Yellow Taxi and Uber's percent Change in Number of Dispatched Trips from Previous Week.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
weather_week_1 <- weather_week %>%
  mutate(`Pickup Start Date` = as.POSIXct(`Pickup Start Date`)) %>%
  filter(`Pickup Start Date` != "2017-12-31")
weather_vis <- ggplot(data = weather_week_1, aes(x = `Pickup Start Date`)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Uber, colour="Uber")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Uber, colour="Uber")) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = Yellow, color="Yellow Taxi")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Yellow, color="Yellow Taxi")) +
  xlab("Pickup Start Date") +
  ylab("% Change in Number of Dispatched Trips from Previous Week")
rainfall_vis <- ggplot(data = weather_week_1, aes(x = `Pickup Start Date`)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = `Weekly Rainfall`, color="Rainfall")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Weekly Rainfall`, color="Rainfall")) +
  ylab("Weekly Rainfall (Inches)")
```

```{r rainfall_vis, fig.caption = "Weekly Rainfall in New York City in 2017",fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/rainfall_vis.png", dpi = 120 )
```

```{r weather_vis, fig.caption = "Yellow Taxi and Uber's % Change in Number of Dispatched Trips from Previous Week in 2017",fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/weather_vis.png", dpi = 120 )
```
According to Figure \@ref(fig:rainfall_vis) and Figure \@ref(fig:weather_vis), when weekly rainfall is high, Uber usually have less percent decline in total number of dispatched trips comparing to the total number of trips from previous week than yellow cab does. Uber passengers pay higher fare on rainy days becasue of Uber's pricing model. Since taxi drivers do not get paid more on rainy days, they tend to work less than Uber drivers, which limits the options for passengers. Passengers sometimes have to choose the more costly Uber instead [@citylab].

## Recommendations to Taxi Passengers
We suggest passengers to use our Shiny App to choose a pick up zone of their interest and then decide when is the most favorable time for them to travel from that zone to any of the three airports in New York.
