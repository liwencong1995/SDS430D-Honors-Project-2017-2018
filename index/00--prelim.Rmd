# Acknowledgements {-}
I would love to thank my thesis advisor Benjamin Baumer, Assistant Professor of Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College, for encouraging me to challenge myself and guiding me through this project. I want to thank Jordan Crouser for being my second reader and help me to revise my paper. I also want to thank all my friends and my roommates for their love and support.
