# Introduction
## Motivation
When is the best time during a day to travel to JFK Airport from Brooklyn? How much tip do passengers usually pay to the taxi drivers? Is the \$52 flat rate from Manhattan to JFK Airport appropriate? Questions about New York City taxicabs are frequently asked by people travelling in taxis in New York City. New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) provides publicly accessible yellow and green taxi trip records on [their website](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) for people to investigate and answer these questions. However, it is not easy to work with taxi trip data provided by TLC, because there are more than 250,000 taxi trips happening everyday in New York City [@emma2017], resulting in large size of the datasets. The size of 2017 yellow taxi trip data csv file is about 10 GB, and this dataset is too big to be processed in an R session. We call data that is too big to be loaded into R environment but not too big to be saved on a hard drive medium data.

Working with medium data, such as the taxi TLC trips records, in **R** is not an easy task. Loading medium-sized data into the **R** environment takes a long time and might crash an **R** session. Creating a user-friendly platform that allows **R** users to easily work with medium data is our motivation. In our study, we focus on New York City taxicab data because there are a lot of interesting questions about New York City taxicabs that we want to explore. 

New York City taxi drivers, passengers, and New York City TLC are the three parties who are closely involved in the New York City taxi industry. Each party has its own needs. Better understanding the needs of the three parties and providing solutions to satisfy their needs is the goal of this thesis.

This work contains two main components. The first component is building the tool to work with the TLC taxi trip data, and the second component is using the tool we build to understand the taxicab and e-hail service use in New York City.

## Background
### Yellow Taxi
NYC Taxicabs are operated by private firms and licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). TLC issues medallions to taxicabs, and every taxicab must have a medallion to operate. There were 13,437 yellow medallion taxicabs licenses in 2014, and taxi patronage has declined since 2011 because of the competition caused by rideshare services [@wikipediataxi].

### Green Taxi
The apple green taxicabs in New York City are called Boro taxis and they are only allowed to pick up passengers in the outer boroughs and in Manhattan above East 96th and West 110th Streets. Historically, only the yellow medallion taxicabs were allowed to pick up passengers on the street. However, since 95% of yellow taxi pick-ups occurred in Manhattan to the South of 96th Street and at the two airports, the Five Borough Taxi Plan was started to allow green taxis to fill in the gap in outer boroughs in the summer of 2013 [@greentaxi].

### Uber
Uber Technologies Inc. is an American technology company that operates private cars worldwide. Uber drivers use their own cars, instead of corporate-owned vehicles, to pick up passengers [@uberweb]. Uber NYC was launched in May 2011. In NYC, Uber uses 'upfront pricing', meaning that riders are informed about the fares that they will pay before requesting a ride, and gratuity is not required. Riders are given the opportunity to compare different transportations' fares before making their decisions on which one to choose [@ubernyc]. 

### Lyft
Similar to Uber, Lyft is also an on-demand transportation company, and it operates the Lyft car transportation mobile app. Lyft is the main competitor of Uber, and it came into market in July 2014 in New York City [@ubernyc]. 

## Literature Review 
### New York City Traffic and Taxi
New York City is one of the most popular cities in the United States. New York City's traffic is a popular topic in journalism, and different aspects of it has been studied by journalists. New York City's traffic is a "nightmare", and the city officials have long been trying to solve the congestion problem. In 2009, New York City was voted to be the U.S. city with the "angriest and most aggressive drivers", and the bad temper of drivers are exacerbated by New York City's severe cogestion [@reaney2009]. 

How bad is the cogestion? In "NYC is already tired of Christmas and Donald Trump", New York City has been described as "the city that never moves" [@furfaro2016]. What has led to the congestion in the city? According to "Uber and Lyft cars now outnumber yellow cabs in NYC 4 to 1", "the city streets are being engineered to create traffic congestion, to slow traffic down, to favor bikers and pedestrians" so that drivers will have the incentive to leave their cars at home and turn to mass transit or bicycles [@sugar2017]. 

No matter how miserable the driving experiences are, taxi drivers have no luxury to choose alternative transportation, and instead thay have to consistently drive their cabs, which are usually surrounded by bad traffic, in order to make a living.

### Competition between New York City taxi and e-hail services
```{r totals-by-car-type, fig.cap= "NYC Monthly Taxi Pickups" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/totals_by_car_type.png", dpi = 150 )
```

As shown in the visulization above [@schneider2015], the number of New York City yellow taxi trips has been consistently declining for about 4 years, and the number of Uber and Lyft trips keep increasing. In 2017, for the first time, the total number of monthly Uber trips exceeded the number of yellow taxi trips. 

Some studies have shown how competitive Uber and Lyft are. In 2017, Uber and Lyft registered vehicles outnumbered NYC yellow cabs by 4 to 1 [@sugar2017]. Even though yellow cabs used to be the most popular street-hail transportation service in New York City, passengers nowadays tend to choose the more convenient options, ride-hailing apps [@hu2017].

Data scientists from the University of Cambridge in the UK and the University of Namur in Belgium found that yellow taxi rides are on average \$1.40 cheaper than Uber X, which is one type of economy ride service offered by Uber [@uberx]. Moreover, Uber appears more expensive for trips that are cheaper than \$35, and less expensive than yellow taxi ride for trips that are more expensive than \$35. Therefore, for short trips, taking a taxi is more affordable [@guerrini2015].

Apps, such as Openstreetcab, that compare the price of Uber and taxi trips are designed to help customers to compare the fares of different transportations [@guerrini2015].

### `etl` R package
Working with taxi trip data is not an easy task, because of the large size of the taxi trip datasets [@emma2017]. Loading these datasets into **R** environment takes a long time and might crush an **R** session. Taxi trip datasets are classified as medium data, because they are too big to be processed in an R session but not too big to be saved on a hard drive. 

The `etl` **R** package creates a user-friendly platform that allows **R** users to easily work with medium data with the extract, transform, load framework, which is commonly konwn as ETL in computing [@wikipedia]. The `ETL` process has been set up [@pkgetl] in **R** to facilitate etl operations for medium data, and it is designed to work with any general data set. Packages that are specific to  perticular data sets are needed to be written in order to better work with complex medium-sized data sets.

## Contribution
This thesis has two main components: the `nyctaxi` **R** package, which helps users to analyze the New York City street-hail services' data in **R**, and recommendations for taxi drivers, passengers, and TLC officials. In addition to the two main parts, we focus on making all analysis and visulizations in this study reproducible. 

### 'nyctaxi' Package
`nyctaxi` is an **R** package that help users to easily get access to New York City Taxi, Uber and Lyft trip data through Extract, Transform, and Load functions (ETL) [@pkgetl]. This package facilitates ETL to deal with medium data that are too big to store in memory on a laptop. Users are given the option to choose specific years and months as the input parameters of the three ETL functions, and a connection to a populated SQL database will be returned as the output. Users do not need to learn SQL queries, since all user interaction is in **R**.

### Reproducible Research
In `R Markdown: Integrating A Reproducible Analysis Tool into Introductory Statistics`, the authors have presented experimental and statistical evidence that _R Markdown_ replaced the antiquated and hard-to-reproduce `copy-and-paste workflow`, and makes creating fully-reprodicible statistical analysis straight-forward [@baumer2014].

Reproducible research and open source are two main points of emphasis in this honors project. As scholars place more emphasis on the reproducibility of research studies, it is essential for us to make our data and code openly available for people to redo the analysis. 

`Knitr` [@pkgknitr] and Github are used in this project to make the study reproducible, ranging from the initial data source to the `nyctaxi` package to the statistical data analysis. We used an **R** package called `thesisdown` to typeset this paper, this tool allows authors to create reproducible and dynamic technical report in **R** Markdown. It also allows users to embed **R** code and interactive applicationis, and output into PDF, Word, ePub, or gitbook doocuments. `thesisdown` helps users to efficiently put together any paper with similar format [@pkgthesisdown].

Github is used to store the scripts for `nyctaxi` and this thesis. `nyctaxi` is available on CRAN for people to download and install [@pkgnyctaxi], and the source code for data analysis in this thesis is available under the Github account of the author so that scholars can easily access the  information that thery are interested in. In terms of tables, figures, and anything included in the Appendix attached to this thesis, scripts that are used to generate them are included in the Github repository.  

### Recommendations for taxi drivers, passengers, and TLC officials

NYC Taxi drivers want to make the most profit. Taxi passengers want the cheapest and most convenient way of transportantion. Since Uber and Lyft launched their services in New York City, many consumers started to demand the cheaper e-hail services [@sugar2017]. TLC wants to protect both taxi drivers and passengers, and it creates policies to make NYC taxi more accessible to consumers who really need this service. In Chapters 3 to 5, we analyze what each party wants and try to find a way for them to be achieve their goals.
