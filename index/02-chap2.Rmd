# An investigation of NYC Taxi Driver' Bias in Customers Selection {#chapter2}

## Question of Interest
On August 7th, 2015, a New York City taxi driver has been fined $25,000 for failing to pick up two African American passengers, and instead giving two white passengers a ride. There are rumors that say NYC taxi drivers discriminate. However, in NYC, yellow cabs are required to take you anywhere in NYC (any of the 5 boroughs), and they cannot refuse to take any passengers.

In this study, I would love to investigate the locations of pickups and dropoffs in NYC and try to get some insights of this social issue. I will generate heat maps to illustrate the differences in the number of dropoff in different neighborhoods.
