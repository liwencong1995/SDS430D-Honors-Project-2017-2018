# New York City Taxi Drivers {#chapter3}
The income of Taxi drivers in New York City comes from two sources: taxi fare and tips. Taxi fare is usually calculated by the meters installed in the taxis, and the rate of fare cannot be changed by taxi drivers. Therefore, in order to make more profit, taxi drivers prefer to pick up passengers who offer big amount of tips. What are the regions that provide the most tips to yellow taxicab drivers?

In this analysis, we will focus on trip data collected in 2017. Descriptions of variables mentioned in the following chapters can be found in Appendix B. 

In order to answer questions regarding to taxi trips' tips, we filter out trips that are not paid by credit or debit card, because taxi drivers usually do not correctly record the amount of tips paid by cash or check (Appendix C)[@foirequest].  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(etl)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(webshot)
library(sp)
data("taxi_zone_lookup")
data("taxi_zones")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
db <- src_mysql("nyctaxi", user = "wli37", host = "scidb.smith.edu", password = "Calculati0n")
taxi <- etl("nyctaxi", db)
```

As mentioned in the previous chapter, we can utlize the connection to a MySQL database to run data analysis in MySQL for medium-sized data.
Since we are using all 12 month data from 2017 in this analysis, it is impractical to load all data needed into **R** environment. Instead, we want to only load a fraction of the 2017 Yellow Taxi data from MySQL database. 

In this section, we only want to load trip records with payment type equals to 1, which represents credit card. Only trip records with payment type credit card have accurate information on tip amount. Let's load the 2017 trip record into **R** environment by using the MySQL connection we just generated, `taxi`.

yellow_2017 <- taxi %>%

yellow_2017_summary <- bind_rows(yellow_2017_summary_1, yellow_2017_summary_2)
```

## Aggregated Zone-level Tip Amount
Instead of the nominal amount of tips, we want to focus on the percentage of tips that passengers pay in addition to the total fare amount. Therefore, we use tip amount over fare amount to calculate the percent tip. We then calculated the mean percent tip, mean distances travelled, mean number of minutes spent travelling, and total number of trips of each pick-up and drop-off pair in 2017 to get the aggregated zone-level information in order to compare the percent tip passengers pay in each zone. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
yellow_2017_summary <- yellow_2017 %>%
  mutate(year = year(tpep_pickup_datetime),
         month = month(tpep_pickup_datetime),
         tip_perct = tip_amount/fare_amount) %>%
  group_by(year, month, PULocationID, DOLocationID) %>%
  summarise(avg_tip = mean(tip_perct), 
            trips = n(),
            avg_dis = mean(trip_distance),
            avg_duration = mean(duration))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
fwrite(yellow_2017_summary, "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/yellow_2017_summary.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data(taxi_zone_lookup)
yellow_2017_summary <- data.table::fread("/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/data/yellow_2017_summary.csv")
```

Each taxi trip has pick-up and drop-off locations associated with it, and there are 263 known taxi zones. Taxi meters sometimes do not function properly, so the information recorded is not always accurate. When taxi meters dysfunction, taxi pick-up and drop-off locations are labelled as "Unknown". We only want to include trips coming from and going to known taxi zones in this analysis.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tip_region <- yellow_2017_summary %>%
  rename(LocationID = PULocationID)%>%
  left_join(taxi_zone_lookup, by = "LocationID") %>%
  rename(PULocationID = LocationID) %>%
  arrange(year, month, desc(avg_tip)) %>%
  rename(LocationID = DOLocationID)%>%
  left_join(taxi_zone_lookup, by = "LocationID") %>%
  rename(DOLocationID = LocationID) %>%
  arrange(year, month, desc(avg_tip)) %>%
  filter(Zone.x != "Unknown") %>%
  filter(Zone.y != "Unknown")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tip_region_1 <- tip_region %>%
  mutate(avg_tip = avg_tip*100)

region_vis <- ggplot(data = tip_region_1, aes(x = avg_tip) ) +
  xlab("Percent Tip") +
  ylab("Count") +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(20), col = "red",linetype = "longdash") +
  #geom_text(aes(x=20, y = 38000, label="20%")) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(25), col = "red",linetype = "longdash") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(30), col = "red",linetype = "longdash") + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50))
```

```{r region-vis, fig.cap= "Percent Tip Paid by Passengers in Each Pick-up And Drop-off Pair in NYC" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/region_vis.png", dpi = 120 )
```

Figure \@ref(fig:region-vis) is a histogram of mean tip percents for all known pick-up and drop-off zone pairs. The red, green, and yellow dash lines are drawn at 20%, 25%, and 30%, which are the default percentage of tips that are shown on the touch panel for credit and debit car payments (see Figure \@ref(fig:taxi-screen)), and passengers tend to pick the the lowest default percent tip.

```{r taxi-screen, fig.cap= "Tip Payment Page on New York City Touch Panel" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/taxi-screen.jpg", dpi = 100 )
```

### Pick-up Zone Percent Tips Amount
Taxi drivers are required to be indifferent to where passengers are going. It is illegal for New York city taxi drivers to refuse service because of passengers' race, ethnicity, cultural background, disbility, gender, or destination [@nyctlc]. Taxi drivers cannot choose where the passengers want to go, and instead they can only choose which pick-up zone they would prefer to drive around to get hailed. Therefore, it makes sense to investigate the average amount of tips paid by passengers departed from each pick-up zone. What are the taxi pick-up zones that have the highest percent tips paid by passengers?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
pickup_vis <- region_vis %+% tip_pickup
```

```{r pickup-vis, fig.cap= "Percent Tip Paid by Passengers on Each Pick-up Taxi Zone in NYC" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/pickup_vis.png", dpi = 150 )
```

We created a histogram to visualize the distribution of average percent tips paid for all pick-up zones. As show in Figure \@ref(fig:pickup-vis), the first peak is around 20%, which is the cheapest default option on the touch panel for passengers to chose. 

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
tip_pickup <- yellow_2017_summary %>%
  group_by(year, month, PULocationID) %>%
  summarise(avg_tip = round(mean(avg_tip), 2) *100, 
            num_trips=sum(trips),
            avg_dis = round(mean(avg_dis),2),
            avg_duration = round(mean(avg_duration),2)) %>%
  rename(LocationID = PULocationID)%>%
  left_join(taxi_zone_lookup, by = "LocationID") %>%
  rename(PULocationID = LocationID) %>%
  arrange(year, month, desc(avg_tip)) %>%
  filter(Zone != "Unknown")
tip_pickup_1 <- tip_pickup %>%
  filter(num_trips > 10)
names(tip_pickup_1) <- c("Year", "Month", "PULocationID","Average % Tips", "Trips","Average Distance","Average Duration","Borough","Zone")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(tip_pickup_1[1:10, c(8:9,4)],
      caption = "Ten taxi pick-up zones with the highest average tip in January, 2017",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```
We also calculated the average percent tip paid for each pick-up zone as shown in Table 3.1. According to Table 3.1, 6 out of 10 taxi zones with the highest average percent tips are in Queens. At a first glance, Queens seems to be a good place for taxi drivers to go and pick up passengers to make more money.

### Which taxi zones are the most popular ones for pick-ups?

Which pick-up zones have the highest number of taxi trip pick-ups? We can create a heat map to visualizae the number of trips for each pick-up zones on a map of New York City Taxi Zones.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tip_pickup_zone <- tip_pickup %>%
  group_by(PULocationID) %>%
  summarise(avg_tip = round(mean(avg_tip), 2), 
            num_trips=sum(num_trips),
            avg_dis = round(mean(avg_dis),2),
            avg_duration = round(mean(avg_duration),2)) %>%
  rename(LocationID = PULocationID)%>%
  left_join(taxi_zone_lookup, by = "LocationID") %>%
  rename(PULocationID = LocationID) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_trips))

pick_up_zones <- merge(taxi_zones, tip_pickup_zone, by.x = "LocationID", by.y = "PULocationID")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
reds = colorNumeric("Reds", domain = NULL)
#create visulization
num_trip <- leaflet(data = pick_up_zones) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap)%>%
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~reds(num_trips),
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              weight = 1,
              opacity = 0.2) %>%
  setView(lat = 40.7128, lng = -74.0060, zoom = 11)

saveWidget(num_trip, file = "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/figure/num_trip.html")
URL <- "/Users/priscilla/Desktop/Honors Thesis/figure/num_trip.html"
webshot(URL, "figure/num_trip.png", cliprect = "viewport")
```

```{r num-trip, fig.cap="Number of Pick-ups in Each Taxi Zone", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/num_trip.png", dpi = 200 )
```
In Figure \@ref(fig:num-trip), taxi zones with more number of pick-ups are colored by darker shades of orange, and it is obvious that Manhattan and La Guardia Airport are the most popular locations for taxi pick-ups.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
names(tip_pickup_zone) <- c("PULocationID", "Average % Tips", "Number of Trips", "Average Distance", "Average Duration", "Borough", "Zone")
kable(tip_pickup_zone[1:10, c(6,7,3)], 
      caption = "Ten taxi zones with the highest number of pick-ups",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```
Table 3.2 tells which specific taxi zones have the highest number of pick-ups, and 9 out of the top 10 taxi zones that have the most number of pick-ups are located in Manhattan. There are about 6000 yellow taxi pick-ups in the top 10 taxi zones everyday in 2017.

### Which pick-up zones have the highest percent tips? 
Most yellow cab pick-ups occur in Manhattan. If we focus on the pick-up zones that have at least 1 trip per hour (or 24 trips per day), we will observe that many taxi pick-up zones with the highest percent tips are not necessarily the ones with the highest number of pick-ups. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#pick a threshold for the cutoff number of trips
pickup_zone_24 <- tip_pickup_zone %>%
  filter(`Number of Trips` >= (24*365)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Average % Tips`))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(pickup_zone_24[1:10, c(6,7,2)], caption = "Ten taxi pick-up zones with the highest percent tip (taxi zones has at least 1 pick-up per hour)",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE
      )
```
People might think it is more reasonable to see a list that is populated with zones in Manhattan, since that's where most of the wealthy people live. However, Table 3.3 shows that passengers who get on taxis from certain zones in Brooklyn and Queens also pay a lot of tips. Taxi drivers who would love to get more tips compensation can drive to the zones listed above to pick-up passengers.

If we focus on the pick-up zones that have more than 1 trip per minute (or 24 trips per hour), then we observe that all pick-up zones that have the highest percent tips are in Manhattan besides La Guardia Airport.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pickup_zone_60 <- tip_pickup_zone %>%
  filter(`Number of Trips` >= (24*365*60)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Average % Tips`))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(pickup_zone_60[1:10, c(6,7,2)], caption = "Ten taxi pick-up zones with the highest percent tip (taxi zones has at least 1 pick-up per minute)",
      format = "latex",
      align = 'c', 
      escape = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

There are more than 100 times more yellow cab pick-ups that happen in Manhattan everyday than in Brooklyn. By comparing the average tip percent in Table 3.3 and Table 3.4, we observe that 8 out of 10 average percent tips in taxi zones with high pick-up numbers in Table 3.4 are lower than average percent tips in taxi zones with low pick-up numbers in Table 3.3. Therefore, there could be a correlation between number of trips and average percent tips that passengers pay, and this can be futher studied with more taxi-zone-specific data, such as median household income, provided.

## What features of taxi trips increase the percent tip amount that passengers pay?
So far, we have learned what pick-up zones offer the highest percent tip. Now, we want to dig into the relationships between percent tip and taxi-zone-specific variables. 

### Does trip distance increase the percent tips paid by passengers? 
Do longer trips result in higher tip percent? It takes taxi drivers more time to complete longer trips, so passengers might want to compensate taxi drivers more. I personally pay higher percent of tips for longer rides, so I believe trip distance has an impact on percentage of tips paid.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tip_distance <- lm(avg_tip ~ avg_dis + PULocationID + DOLocationID, data = tip_region)
summary(tip_distance)$coef[1:2,]
```

Acoording to the simple linear regression result, trip distance does have a negative impact on the percent of tips paid, controlling for both pick-up and drop-off locations. Since the number of obervations in this regression model is big, the p-value quickly goes to zero. Therefore, in this regression, p-value does not matter so much. What is important in this result is the negative correlation between average percent tips and average distance that a taxi travels.

The negative correlation could be caused by a psychological reason. Long trips cost more than short trips. For a constant tip percent, the nominal value of tip amount cost more for longer trips. For example, for a \$100 trip, 20% tip costs \$20; for a \$50 trip, 20% tip costs \$10. Even though consumers are paying the same percent amount of tips, \$20 is more expensive than \$10. Therefore, consumers might decide to pay less percent tip for longer trips.

### Do passengers pay more tips during rush hours? 
New York City Taxi Fare & Limousine Commission has information on how New York City taxi fare amount is calculated on their [official website](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml). 

#### Metered Fare Information
* Onscreen rate is ‘Rate #01 – Standard City Rate.’
* The initial charge is $2.50.
* Plus 50 cents per 1/5 mile or 50 cents per 60 seconds in slow traffic or when the vehicle is stopped.
* In moving traffic on Manhattan streets, the meter should “click” approximately every four downtown blocks, or one block going cross-town (East-West).
* There is a 50-cent MTA State Surcharge for all trips that end in New York City or Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange or Putnam Counties.
* There is a 30-cent Improvement Surcharge. 
* There is a daily 50-cent surcharge from 8pm to 6am.
* There is a $1 surcharge from 4pm to 8pm on weekdays, excluding holidays.
* Passengers must pay all bridge and tunnel tolls.
* Your receipt will show your total fare including tolls. Please take your receipt.
* The driver is not required to accept bills over $20.
* Please tip your driver for safety and good service.
* There are no charges for extra passengers or bags.

The metered fare rate information is collected from TLC rate of fare webpage [@tlcfarerate].

In taxi fare calculation, the only unknown variable is slow-traffic time, and all other variables were collected by the meters installed on each medallion taxi for each trip. It is reasonable to assume that for trips with the same pick-up and drop-off locations, the longer the total slow traffic time is, the longer the trip would take. Taxi drivers are compensated for both the normal-speed trip distance and the time spent in slow-traffic. According to the fare calculation algorithm, in moving traffic on Manhattan streets, the meter should “click” approximately every four downtown blocks, or one block going cross-town (East-West); in slow traffic, the meter should "click" every 60 seconds. Therefore, slow traffic increases the minute per mile ratio. 

New York City has the worst traffic jams, and it has overtaken Miami to be voted the U.S. city with the angriest and most aggressive drivers in 2009, according to a survey on road rage. Bad traffic also causes slow-traffic, and taxi drivers tend to get stuck in traffic during rush hours [@reaney2009]. Does minute per mile ratio have an impact on the percent tip that passengers pay? Do passengers compensate taxi drivers more during rush hours? Are passengers sympathetic to taxi drivers for the time they spend in slow traffic?

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
yellow_2017_summary_small <- yellow_2017_summary %>%
  mutate(min_per_mile = avg_duration/avg_dis) %>%
  filter(trips > 30)

min_mile_ratio <- lm(avg_tip ~ min_per_mile, data = yellow_2017_summary_small)
summary(min_mile_ratio)$coef[1:2,]
```

As shown in the regression result, `min_per_mile` ratio does have a positive impact on percent tips. Since trips with slow traffic can be depicted by high minute per mile ratio, passengers do pay more tips during rush hours. 

## Recommendations to Taxi Drivers
Our analysis has suggested that taxi passengers are sympathetic with the drivers who have to suffer the cogestion in New York City, and taxi drivers do get compensated more during rush hours. Therefore, we hope that taxi drivers would feel better during rush hours by knowing 
that passengers do pay for tips to compensate the negative feelings that drivers carry in cogestion.
