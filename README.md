I will use the template in `thesisdown` package to format this Honors Project, and a few adjustments will be made according to the Honors Project format requirement of Smith College.

Smith College format of project: 
<http://libguides.smith.edu/theses/honors-projects>
Page Format: Text should be formatted for 8½ x 11 inch sheets. Margins must be 1½ inches on the left and 1 inch on the right, top, and bottom. Typefaces should be either 10 or 12 characters per inch and consistent throughout the manuscript. All text should be double-spaced except for Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Figures, lengthy tables, quotations, and footnotes.
